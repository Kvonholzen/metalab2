# How to contribute?

We welcome researchers interested in contributing to Metalab. Please contact us at metalab-project@googlegroups.com

Contributions can take various forms:

- *Adding unpublished data.* Ideally we can link to a report on the data, for example on OSF. Then contact the curator with a link and if possible all necessary data.
- *Suggesting and/or adding published papers* not yet included. Simply email the curator, ideally with a pdf. If you are the author, try to make sure that all necessary data is either included or provided in your email.
- *Creating new meta-analyses.* If you are interested in creating a new meta-analysis, check out the tutorial page.
- *Contribute existing meta-analyses.* If you already have a completed meta-analysis, make sure to use the MetaLab template and get in touch about integrating it into MetaLab.
